# Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:
# islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
#            [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]



def find_islands(input_array):
    # loop through array of arrays
        # loop through each individual array 
            #
