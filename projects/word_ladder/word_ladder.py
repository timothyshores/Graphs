# Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, return the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

# Only one letter can be changed at a time.
# Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.

# Note:
# Return None if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words have the same length.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
# You may assume no duplicates in the word list.

# Sample:
# beginWord = "hit"
# endWord = "cog"
# return: ['hit', 'hot', 'cot', 'cog']
# beginWord = "sail"
# endWord = "boat"
# ['sail', 'bail', 'boil', 'boll', 'bolt', 'boat']
# beginWord = "hungry"
# endWord = "happy"
# None
